abstract: "Geographical information systems (GIS) practitioners worldwide enjoy a growing array of free and open source software (FOSS) options. This software has expanded the accessibility of GIS in economically developing countries while fostering local technical expertise. This article reviews FOSS GIS uptake and advocacy in South America, especially how it relates to a climate of political friendliness toward FOSS in the region. The use or absence of FOSS GIS is assessed in public-facing web maps in South America, first at the national government level, and then at the provincial level using Argentina as a country of study. Local technical support groups and software development initiatives surrounding FOSS GIS in South America are then summarized. Finally, three case studies are presented of notable efforts to build FOSS GIS techni- cal communities at the local level: the FOSSGIS Brasil online magazine, the Geoinquietos Argentina professional network, and the FOSS.4GIS.GOV conference in Brazil. A study of the leaders, dynamics, and practices of these groups can inform others in similar circumstances around the world who are trying to promote FOSS GIS adoption, development, skills, and services."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: " 全世界的地理信息系统从业人员享有越来越多的免费和开源软件（FOSS)选择。这种软件扩大了地理信息系统在经济发展中国家的使用范围，同时促进了当地技术专长的发展。本文回顾了南美洲对FOSS GIS的吸收和宣传，特别是它与该地区对自由和开放源码软件的政治友好气氛的关系。在南美洲面向公众的网络地图中评估了自由和开放源码软件GIS的使用与否，首先是在国家政府一级，然后是以阿根廷为研究对象的省一级。然后总结了南美洲围绕FOSS GIS的地方技术支持小组和软件开发方案。最后，介绍了在地方一级建立FOSS GIS技术社区的三个案例研究：FOSSGIS Brasil在线杂志、Geoinquietos Argentina professional network（地理信息学阿根廷职业网络）和巴西的FOSS.4GIS.GOV会议。对这些团体的领导人、动态和做法的研究，可以为世界各地处于类似情况下的为促进FOSS GIS的采用、发展、技能和服务而努力的其他团体提供参考。"
