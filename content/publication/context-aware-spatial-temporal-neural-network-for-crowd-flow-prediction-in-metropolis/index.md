abstract: "Crowd flow prediction is of great importance in a wide range of applications from urban planning, traffic control to public safety. It aims to predict the inflow (the traffic of crowds entering a region in a given time interval) and outflow (the traffic of crowds leaving a region for other places) of each region in the city with knowing the historical flow data. In this paper, we propose DeepSTN+, a deep learning-based convolutional model, to predict crowd flows in the metropolis. First, Deep- STN+ employs the ConvPlus structure to model the long- range spatial dependence among crowd flows in different regions. Further, PoI distributions and time factor are combined to express the effect of location attributes to introduce prior knowledge of the crowd movements. Finally, we propose an effective fusion mechanism to stabilize the training process, which further improves the performance. Extensive experimental results based on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, i.e., DeepSTN+ reduces the error of the crowd flow prediction by approximately 8%∼13% compared with the state-of-the-art baselines."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "人群流量预测在城市规划、交通控制和公共安全等广泛的应用中具有重要意义。它的目的是在知道历史流量数据的情况下，预测城市中每个区域的流入（在一定时间间隔内进入某个区域的人流）和流出（离开某个区域前往其他地方的人流）。本文提出了基于深度学习的卷积模型DeepSTN+来预测大都市的人群流量。首先，Deep- STN+采用ConvPlus结构来模拟不同区域人群流量之间的长距离空间依赖性。进一步，结合PoI分布和时间因子来表达位置属性的影响，引入人群流动的先验知识。最后，我们提出了一种有效的融合机制来稳定训练过程，从而进一步提高性能。基于两个真实数据集的大量实验结果证明了我们模型的优越性，即与最先进的基线相比，DeepSTN+降低了约8%～13%的人群流动预测误差。"
