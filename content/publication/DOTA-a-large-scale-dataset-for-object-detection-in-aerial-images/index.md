abstract: "Object detection is an important and challenging prob- lem in computer vision. Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object detection in natural scenes, such successes have been slow to aerial imagery, not only because of the huge variation in the scale, orien- tation and shape of the object instances on the earth’s sur- face, but also due to the scarcity of well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes. To advance object detection research in Earth Vision, also known as Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, we introduce a large-scale Dataset for Object deTection in Aerial images (DOTA). To this end, we collect 2806 aerial images from different sensors and plat- forms. Each image is of the size about 4000 × 4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains 188, 282 instances, each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.) quadrilateral. To build a baseline for object detection in Earth Vision, we evaluate state-of- the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA. Experiments demonstrate that DOTA well represents real Earth Vision applications and are quite challenging."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "物体检测是计算机视觉中一个重要且具有挑战性的问题。虽然在过去的十年中，自然场景中的物体检测取得了重大进展，但这种成功在航空图像上却进展缓慢，这不仅是因为地球表面物体实例的尺度、方向和形状存在巨大差异，还因为航空场景中缺少对物体的具有良好标注的数据集。为了推进地球视觉（Earth Vision，又称地球观测与遥感）中的物体检测研究，我们引入了一个大规模的面向地物检测的航空影像数据集（DOTA）。为此，我们收集了2806幅来自不同传感器和平台的航空图像。每幅图像的大小约为4000×4000像素- els，并包含了各种尺度、方向和形状的物体。这些DOTA图像由航空图像解读专家使用15种常见的物体类别进行注释。完全注释的DOTA图像-年龄包含188，282个实例，每个实例都由一个任意的（8 d.o.f.）四边形标记。为了在地球视觉中建立一个对象检测的基准，文章在DOTA上评估了最先进的目标检测算法。实验表明，DOTA可以很好地代表了真实的地球视觉应用，并且相当具有挑战性。"
