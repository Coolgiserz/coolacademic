### What does FOSS and FOSS GIS mean?
{{% fragment %}} 
- Freedom to <span style="color: red;">**run**</span> the program as you wish

- freedom to <span style="color: red;">**study and change**</span> the program

- freedom to <span style="color: red;">**redistribute**</span> copies

- freedom to <span style="color: red;">**distribute copies of your modified versions**</span>

<!-- ### FOSS GIS and proprietary GIS -->

##### proprietary GIS software

- ArcGIS
- MapInfo
- Manifold GIS

---
##### FOSS GIS software
- **Desktop-based mapping and data processing**:
  *QGIS、GRASS、gvSIG、SAGA*

- **Web service publishing**:

  *MapServer、GeoServer*

- **Website programming**:

  *Leaflet、OpenLayers*

- **Backend data storage**:

  *PostreSQL、PostGIS*

### Why should we pay attention to FOSS GIS in South Amerca?
1. there is a <span style="color: red;">**substantial FOSS GIS adoption**</span> occurring in some South American governments,

2. this uptake maybe occurring for <span style="color: red;">**a different mix of reasons**</span>  than observed or expected with FOSS adoptions in the Global North.

## 0x02 Public openness toward FOSS in South America
---

<font size="6">South America has seen <span style="color: red;">a unique variety of laws and decrees</span>
 at the city, state, and federal levels <span style="color: red;">promoting FOSS use on government computers</span></font>

<span><font size="5">Figure 1. Notable country-level policies in South America related to goverment use of FOSS</font></span>
<!-- <center style="font-size:10">南美洲国家政府对于FOSS的政策法令</center> -->

---

Beyond encouraging FOSS, some governments even <span style="color: red;">mandate its use for state business</span>. For examples, 
- Venezuela’s ‘Infogobierno’ law requires public institutions migrate to FOSS

- Bolivia has enacted a series of decrees leading toward public sector migration to FOSS



<font size="6">the tendency to <span style="color: blue;">adopt strict mandates of FOSS</span> was more common in Latin America and Africa than in other parts of the world. 
Policies in other regions tended to take more of a hands-off advisory role.
</font>

---

### Why have these South American governments been so aggressive about adopting FOSS?
- Technical factors 

- Economic factors 

- Social factors 

- Political factors

---
##### Technical factors

- <font size="6">Recent government <span style="color: red;">crackdowns on illegal software copying</span> are leading public institutions to <span style="color: red;">look for lower-cost software alternatives</span></font>

- <font size="6">Some have recognized FOSS solutions as a way to not only economize, but also <span style="color: red;">foster local skills, develop context-specific applications</span>, and <span style="color: red;">institute social changes</span></font>

- <font size="6">These licenses also allow modification and redistribution of the code, providing a way to fix, enhance, or internationalize the software <span style="color: red;">without waiting for a vendor to release a (potentially costly) upgrade</span>. </font>

--- 
##### Economic factors
- An attractive element of FOSS for the public sector is that the software <span style="color: red;">can be distributed without licensing fees</span>

-  <span style="color: red;">The amount of money required to keep proprietary software</span> running in government offices  <span style="color: red;">is substantial</span>

--- 
##### Social factors
- The reasons for government promotion of FOSS in South America go beyond economics, and involve attitudes about <span style="color: red;">society, sovereignty, and the role of the state.</span>

- Chan (2004) noted that this line of reasoning represented a key difference from FOSS promotion in North America, where supporters tended to <span style="color: red;">emphasize FOSS’s protection of consumer freedoms.</span>
---
##### Political factors

-  the idea of FOSS is <span style="color: red;">an avenue to independence from the perceived imperialism of US-based proprietary software companies</span> has appeared across social stratum.

- Free software represents the values: <span style="color: red;">equality, freedom, sovereignty, right to choose, democracy, and development</span>.

## 0x03 FOSS GIS in South America
---
<font size="4"> four countries, which <span style="color: red;">have supported FOSS through legislation or decree</span> at the national level,  <span style="color: red;">using FOSS GIS for their principal map viewers</span> (Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela).</font>

![](images/img2.png)

<font size="2">Brazil is the only country with national support for FOSS that is not using FOSS in its principal map viewer</font>

---
<font size="4"> Most of the provincial sites in the below table are using well-known and basic FOSS GIS software. </font>
![](images/img3.png)

<font size="1">stability and long-term maintenance of some of the sites appear to be challenges.</font>

---
##### Local technical support groups for FOSS GIS
- exchange troubleshooting tips, 

- share ideas and success stories, 

- post employment information,

- arrange conferences and meetups of people with similar skills and interests.

---

##### Local software development

- An important indication of FOSS GIS presence in any region is the local production and improvement of software

- FOSS development is evidence of this process occurring. FOSS GIS development efforts in South America include the aforementioned
  - translation of user interfaces,
  - the testing and use of products,
  - the creation of new software to meet community needs.

--- 

Ibero-America has incubated several FOSS GIS programs that are widely used in South America.
- One of these is gvSIG, a desktop GIS program developed in Valencia, Spain.

- Another GIS, called SPRING, was developed by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE).

- Other open source GIS tools developed by Brazilian government and educational institutions include i3Geo, E-foto, and TerraLib

## 0x04 Case studies of FOSS GIS community activity

---
- FOSS GIS Brasil magazine 

- Geoinquietos Argentina 

- FOSS.4GIS.GOV conferences in Brazil


---

### FOSS GIS Brasil magazine
- the most ambitious effort ever to <span style="color: red;">publish information about FOSS GIS in periodical format</span> was a Portuguese language magazine.

- The magazine included articles about:
  - FOSS GIS software options
  - comparing functionalities of FOSS GIS with proprietary software
  - case studies of successful software implementations in various branches of the Brazilian government
  - interviews with figureheads in the Brazilian FOSS GIS community

--- 

### Geoinquietos Argentina
- Geoinquietos is a network of local groups throughout Ibero- America interested in geospatial sciences and FOSS.
  - the main objective is to  <span style="color: red;">share knowledge and effort</span>

  - the group is completely anarchic; there is  <span style="color: red;">no hierarchy of participants</span>.

  - jovial, relaxed, and occasionally very technical banter


--- 
### Geoinquietos Argentina


  - The Geoinquietos Argentina chapter has been <span style="color: red;">one of the most active of these groups</span>,

  - <span style="color: red;">repeatedly organizing conferences</span> that attract hundreds of people from the Southern Cone area of South America and beyond.
--- 
### FOSS.4GIS.GOV conferences in Brazil

- The success of Geoinquietos Argentina at gathering the FOSS GIS community was noticed in other areas of South America.

- Actually, <span style="color: red;">several notable gatherings of open source GIS software enthusiasts have occurred in Brazil’s capital</span>, but they have largely focused on government applications.

- the FOSS.4GIS.GOV conference <span style="color: red;">brought together hundreds of professionals</span>.

---

## 0x05 Conclusions
---
- <span style="color: red;">FOSS GIS has a strong and growing presence in South America</span>, evidenced by
  - government use of FOSS in interactive map websites,
  - the variety of FOSS technical support groups for GIS and mapping, and the development of software to meet local geoprocessing needs.

--- 
- <span style="color: red;">Some of this success is likely due to the generally friendly attitude toward FOSS throughout the region</span>, where some governments have mandated that FOSS be used, or at least considered, as an alternative to proprietary software.

--- 

- Such affinity toward FOSS includes economic considerations, but also a strong belief <span style="color: red;">that national interest is served by keeping software code transparent and investment money local</span>.

---
- This article discussed three case studies of particularly successful efforts to promote FOSS GIS and rally local user groups through <span style="color: red;">education and sharing of technical expertise</span>.

- The common thread between these case studies is their <span style="color: red;">ability to connect individuals</span>.
